P.07-DOCUMENT PARSER

This is a pdf and excel files parser, where after processing the relevant docs that you upload, 
the model will extract your docs and from the chat session, you can ask about your papers.

For this project, I have used Langchain and Ollama as my main techniques for creating the chatbot
and other modules like pypdf for extracting PDF file, pandas for extracting the excel file
for the frontend, I have used streamlit to give a good UI experience.

what to do?

1. Create an ENV file and download the relevant libraries and add those into requirements.txt
2. Select your ollama model(here i used llama2) and the pull the model "Ollama pull llama2"
3. Then run the frontend "streamlit run app.py"
4. After opening the frontend, you get a streamlit app. It will show a  sidebar and chatbot
5. upload your docs and then click on "Process document" and then starting chatting with the model.
